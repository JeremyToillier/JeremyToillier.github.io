        <h1>Sport Addiction<h1>
  
            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            
            <p>When I was younger, one of my secret dreams was to practice <strong>high level athletics.</strong></p>
            <p>To achieve this, I had to train hard and adopt a way of life that would allow me to achieve my goals.</p>
            <p>I started by playing tennis for 15 years. A sport that has allowed me to develop <strong>different skills:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>First of all, the sense of individual effort because tennis is an individual sport that requires you to manage on your own without relying on anyone.</li>
            <li>This sport, which takes as frustrating, allows you to develop a certain mental strength to get out of a situation and be dangerous.</li>
            <li>This sport also allows to develop a certain coordination for the body members.</li>
            <li>To conclude, this sport allows you to develop both physically and mentally and is a good gateway to reach your dreams.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I invite you to visit my club's internet page, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tcarbresle/">and this is a link</a>.</p>

            <h2>Track & Field</h2>
              
            <p>I have been involved in athletics since the beginning of January 2016.</p>
            
            <p>I started this sport after a long back injury that took me away from any sport for the equivalent of 6 months.</p>
            
            <p>Athletics is a sport that I practice <strong>5 to 6 times a week</strong> because my only objective is to reach the highest level.</p>
            
            <p>This sport has allowed me in 4 years to realize one of my dreams which was to participate in <strong>the French Championships</strong>. Indeed, I had the chance to do this competition in team with my friends on the 4x400m relay. 
            I had the chance <strong>to qualify 4 times as a team</strong> and go to cities such as Niort or Strasbourg which organized the French championships.</p>

            <p>Athletics is perhaps an individual sport, but it does not prevent group training.</p>
            
            </p>Indeed, a lot of friendship are created and allows to pull a group up!
            
            <p>For my part, I spend a lot of time with my partners, whether on or off the track. We do internships together in beautiful places such as the Boulouris site in the south of France.
            There is a strong competitive spirit on the track but the friendship we have with each other helps us to progress together without making war.</p>
