         <strong>Track & Field</strong>
    <p>When I was younger, one of my secret dreams was to practice high level athletics.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, I had to train hard and adopt a way of life that would allow me to achieve my goals.</p>
        <p>I started by playing tennis for 15 years. A sport that has allowed me to develop different skills:<p>
        <p>First of all, the sense of individual effort because tennis is an individual sport that requires you to manage on your own without relying on anyone.
        This sport, which takes as frustrating, allows you to develop a certain mental strength to get out of a situation and be dangerous.</p>
